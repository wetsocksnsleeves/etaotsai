<meta name="description" content="Description
A snakes and ladders replica built with Atmega328 microcontroller and LED matrix &#43; buttons for UI.
Program was written in C and flashed via serial connection with Putty.

What
Relevant knowledge included fundamental understanding of chip specifications, circuits, and C programming.
Timing, bitwise operations, and control via pins were the main components that went into this project.

Result
Understanding the communication between the MCU and its IOs. Exercise control via code." />
