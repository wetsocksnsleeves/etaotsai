<meta name="title" content="Homeserver Build" />
<meta name="description" content="What

Picked and built a dedicated machine as a homeserver.
Created due to an interest to expand my current homelab environment. Wanted to
experiment with various networking tools. And strengthen technical knowledge.

Setup includes:

Proxmox VE as main OS
NAS with RAID 5 configuration
VPN server to enable remote access to home network
Various VMs to experiment with Linux


How

Proxmox VE as OS, ability to manage containers and virtual machines.
TrueNAS for NAS, future plans to utilize HBA (Host Bus Adapter) passthrough.
Wireguard with wgdash for VPN server.


Result

Hands on experience with enterprise level software, VM management, and NAS management.
Solidified conceptual understanding of RAID configurations via practical usage.
Gained further understanding in VPN servers and setting up split &#43; on-demand client
configurations." />
