<meta name="description" content="Why
Couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable calorie tracker that does what I need it to. Given an amount, track calorie intake versus this goal.
Most apps ask too much questions, all this application needs to know is what your goal is.

This application was created to really get my hands dirty with react hooks, next.js functionalities, a refresher on user authentication and database.

How

ü™ù React with Next.js and tailwindcss
üî• Firestore for Authentication and Database
Typescript


Result

User Authentication and Database with Firebase
Beautiful UI
Theme picker


A minimal calorie tracking app that takes on the aesthetic of a receipt/tab.
No 100 question surveys to get you started.
Just tell it your calorie goal and diligently log your meals.
