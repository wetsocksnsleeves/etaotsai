<meta name="description" content="Why
A personal website had always been on the project list, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable
stack to get started. My past experiences building web apps include using react, and frameworks like
Next.js.
Seeing that a personal website contains mainly static content, and maybe a blog section.
I felt like it would be using the wrong tool for the job. Until I came across Hugo.

How

Hugo
CSS
HTML

I started by reading the Hugo documentations, setting up the environments and learning out the structures worked.
I like to get my hands dirty, so I picked out a theme and started reading the structure. After abit, I understood the
way Hugo works and started heavily modifying the theme &ldquo;Bearcub&rdquo;.

Result

Revamped the structure, and colors
Added animations, social icons, and a custom home page
Added features like embedded pdfs, and gallery view

I would ideally use tailwind CSS since that&rsquo;s what I am familiar with, but this experience allowed me to refresh my memory on CSS" />
