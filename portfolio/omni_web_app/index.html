<meta name="description" content="Why
When trying to move content from my phone to my computer, I&rsquo;ve always felt like it was a chore.
If you don&rsquo;t have a fully Apple setup, you&rsquo;d have to opt for google drive and google photos.
So I decided to create a web application, starting off as a local file transfer tool and expanding it to include:
Media downloader, Notes, Gif creator and much more&hellip;

How

Deno
Deno Fresh
Tailwindcss
FFmpeg


User uploads are stored directly onto the server&rsquo;s storage. The website renders the content by fetching what&rsquo;s inside the storage, thumbnails and gifs are then created via FFmpeg if they are non-existent. Keeping everything clean and fast.

Downloads are processed based on what the users selections are. Multiple selections are compressed into a zip file before download prompt, minimising user inputs and effectively improving the user experience.

Result

📁 A local file transfer system. No more sending your content onto another guy&rsquo;s computer.
📶 File upload and Download with visual prompts
✅ Easy selection/deselection
🖼️ Automatic thumbnail generation for both videos and images. Videos are coupled with a gif for fast preview.
🤐 Automatic zipping if downloading multiple files.

  <p><strong>Why</strong><br>
When trying to move content from my phone to my computer, I&rsquo;ve always felt like it was a chore.
If you don&rsquo;t have a fully Apple setup, you&rsquo;d have to opt for google drive and google photos.</p>
<p>So I decided to create a web application, starting off as a local file transfer tool and expanding it to include:
Media downloader, Notes, Gif creator and much more&hellip;

<li>FFmpeg</li>

<p><br>
User uploads are stored directly onto the server&rsquo;s storage. The website renders the content by fetching what&rsquo;s inside the storage, thumbnails and gifs are then created via FFmpeg if they are non-existent. Keeping everything clean and fast.</p>
<p><br>

<strong>Mobile upload using photos</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../images/omni/mobile_uploads.jpg" alt="Mobile Uploads"></p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Multi-select is supported</li>
<li>🔃 Uploading indicator</li>
</ul>
<p>On mobile, user can select media files from either their files, or their photos application.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Video previews</strong>
<img src="../../images/omni/video_preview_feature.gif" alt="Video Preview Feature">
<br>
Video previews and thumbnails are done through generating both a thumbnail and a gif when files are uploaded.
The two are then overlayed and opacity is set based on hover. This greatly improves performance compared to using an embedded video file.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Downloads</strong><br>
The user can then download their selected files on the other device. Completing the transfer process.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/omni/download_on_pc.png" alt="Download on PC"></p>
<p><br>
If multiple files are selected, the tool will automatically compress the given files into a zip. Allowing the user to download all the files at once.</p>
