<meta name="description" content="What:
I designed and built a custom 54 key orthlinear, column staggered split keyboard.
Managing every aspect from designing the PCB, compiling the firmware based on vial,
as well as designing and 3D printing the case with my 3D printers.
PCB Design:

Drawing circuit schematic within KiCad. Understanding the software and the layers into PCB creation.
Optimizing component position and wiring to ensure manufacturability.
Using the Japanese duplex matrix to minimise the number of pins required. Simplifying component sourcing such as RJ45 sockets and a spare RP2040 mcu from previous projects.

Firmware development:

Understanding the value of creating firmware from scratch or utilise matured and existing technologies throughout project. Ultimately, using the vial firmware with easy GUI for keymaps and alterations.
Understanding the structure of the vial firmware. Had to first compile the QMK firmware, requiring past knowledge of C and the ability to troubleshoot and refer to documentations.

  <p><strong>What:</strong></p>
<p>I designed and built a custom 54 key orthlinear, column staggered split keyboard.
Managing every aspect from designing the PCB, compiling the firmware based on vial,
as well as designing and 3D printing the case with my 3D printers.</p>
<p><strong>PCB Design:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Drawing circuit schematic within KiCad. Understanding the software and the layers into PCB creation.</li>
<li>Optimizing component position and wiring to ensure manufacturability.</li>
<li>Using the Japanese duplex matrix to minimise the number of pins required. Simplifying component sourcing such as RJ45 sockets and a spare RP2040 mcu from previous projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firmware development:</strong></p>

<li>Understanding the value of creating firmware from scratch or utilise matured and existing technologies throughout project. Ultimately, using the vial firmware with easy GUI for keymaps and alterations.</li>
<li>Understanding the structure of the vial firmware. Had to first compile the QMK firmware, requiring past knowledge of C and the ability to troubleshoot and refer to documentations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case fabrication:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exporting STEP model from KiCad to fusion 360. And utilising functions such as shell,
mirror and project within the tool to achieve my vision.</li>
<li>3D printed the case using heavily modified Ender 3 series printers.
All setup within my home lab and is managed via the local network using Raspberry Pi Zero Ws.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<p>A fully functional split ergonomic keyboard that required me to demonstrate my ability to:
Carry an idea from paper to reality, solving real world design challenges,
splitting a problem into a structured plan, assessing limitations in my knowledge
and utilising existing technology.</p>
