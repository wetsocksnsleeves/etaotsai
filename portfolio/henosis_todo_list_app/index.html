<meta name="description" content="Why
I was building react apps and was coming across alot of issues with the framework. Particularly inconvient error messages and bugs that ultimately got me nowhere. Still wanting to build a webapp for fun however, I searched online till I came across a great introduction to Next.js and decided to build something with it.

How

Next.js
Tailwind CSS
DragnDrog Module
Firebase

I build the frontend with Next.js and Tailwind. A simple todo list app consisted of looping through a list and rendering relevant html components. Making it looks good with tailwind. And then implementing drag n drop by using existing modules.
I then connected Firebase with the application to realise OAuth and data store and retrive.

Result
A minimal, and reactive web app.
I made my first ever mistake of not redacting my token, as I didn&rsquo;t know anything about web apps prior to this project. So that&rsquo;s one of the biggest takeaways I&rsquo;ve rememberd till today." />
