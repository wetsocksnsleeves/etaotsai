<meta name="description" content="What

Optimising algorithms for space and time efficiency. Implemented many data structures such as
bitvectors, bloomfilters, queues, stack, and maps within ideal space and time efficiency.
Solved various programming problems such as k-mer combinations, chain reactions, and graph problems with theoretical efficiency in mind
Implemented pathfinding algorithms such as BFS and dijkstra. And using it to solve graph related problems.

Result
Understanding the use cases of data structures, how to implement them effectively.
Studying the relationship between empirical and theoretical efficiency.
Studying various foundational programming problems, their place in our systems and how to solve them effectively." />
