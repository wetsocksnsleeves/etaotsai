                            <p><strong>Why</strong><br>
A personal website had always been on the project list, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a suitable
stack to get started. My past experiences building web apps include using react, and frameworks like
Next.js.<br>
Seeing that a personal website contains mainly static content, and maybe a blog section.
I felt like it would be using the wrong tool for the job. Until I came across Hugo.
<br>
<strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hugo</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<p>I started by reading the Hugo documentations, setting up the environments and learning out the structures worked.
I like to get my hands dirty, so I picked out a theme and started reading the structure. After abit, I understood the
way Hugo works and started heavily modifying the theme &ldquo;Bearcub&rdquo;.
<br>
<strong>Result</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Revamped the structure, and colors</li>
<li>Added animations, social icons, and a custom home page</li>
<li>Added features like embedded pdfs, and gallery view</li>
</ul>
<p>I would ideally use tailwind CSS since that&rsquo;s what I am familiar with, but this experience allowed me to refresh my memory on CSS</p>

                        <div class="summary-body">
                            <p><strong>Why</strong><br>
I was building react apps and was coming across alot of issues with the framework. Particularly inconvient error messages and bugs that ultimately got me nowhere. Still wanting to build a webapp for fun however, I searched online till I came across a great introduction to Next.js and decided to build something with it.
<br>
<strong>How</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Next.js</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS</li>
<li>DragnDrog Module</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>
<p>I build the frontend with Next.js and Tailwind. A simple todo list app consisted of looping through a list and rendering relevant html components. Making it looks good with tailwind. And then implementing drag n drop by using existing modules.<br>
I then connected Firebase with the application to realise OAuth and data store and retrive.
<br>
<strong>Result</strong><br>
A minimal, and reactive web app.<br>
I made my first ever mistake of not redacting my token, as I didn&rsquo;t know anything about web apps prior to this project. So that&rsquo;s one of the biggest takeaways I&rsquo;ve rememberd till today.</p>

                            <p><strong>Why</strong><br>
During one of my projects, I had to utilise a series of proxies to bypass a limiter.
I got a CSV off the internet of various different proxies, but I was met with an issue.
The issue was that the interface took in a different format than what I required.
And thus, I decided to automate this manual process by writing a simple python script.
<br>
<strong>How</strong><br>
I read the file and did some basic string manipulation.
<br>
<strong>Result</strong><br>
Formatted hundreds of proxies in seconds. Minutes including the scripting.
Automation via a scripting language is something that I find myself doing regularly,
and this is one of the most easily visualised examples.</p>
