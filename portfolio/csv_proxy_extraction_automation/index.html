<meta name="description" content="Why
During one of my projects, I had to utilise a series of proxies to bypass a limiter.
I got a CSV off the internet of various different proxies, but I was met with an issue.
The issue was that the interface took in a different format than what I required.
And thus, I decided to automate this manual process by writing a simple python script.

How
I read the file and did some basic string manipulation.

Result
Formatted hundreds of proxies in seconds. Minutes including the scripting.
Automation via a scripting language is something that I find myself doing regularly,
and this is one of the most easily visualised examples." />
