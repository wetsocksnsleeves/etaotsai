<meta name="description" content="Making a bash script that turns glow into a live markdown preview tool
glow is a cli tool that allows markdown previews.But I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on whether it supports live previews or not. Other tools also require browsers, which is something that I don&rsquo;t want.
I want something that works in the terminal and stays in the terminal.
Defining my requirements
I needed something really quick and simple. My idea is to run a tmux pane on the side and have the script run glow, and re-run it if the chosen file had been changed.
Not exactly a &ldquo;live&rdquo; preview, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me. I just didn&rsquo;t want to re-run glow manually everytime I change something. Is there a tool for this? Probably but I just couldn&rsquo;t find it. But hey, I get to DIY!
The process
I started off by thinking about python scripts. As I&rsquo;ve had experience automating and writing scripts using it. It&rsquo;s rich package eco-system can do basically anything I wanted it to do." />

<p>I needed something really quick and simple. My idea is to run a tmux pane on the side and have the script run glow, and re-run it if the chosen file had been changed.</p>
<p>Not exactly a &ldquo;live&rdquo; preview, but it&rsquo;s good enough for me. I just didn&rsquo;t want to re-run glow manually everytime I change something. Is there a tool for this? Probably but I just couldn&rsquo;t find it. But hey, I get to DIY!</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
<p>I started off by thinking about python scripts. As I&rsquo;ve had experience automating and writing scripts using it. It&rsquo;s rich package eco-system can do basically anything I wanted it to do.</p>
<p>But then I think it&rsquo;s overkill for this simple wrapper for glow. So I decided to make a bash script despite knowing nothing about bash script. ðŸ˜±</p>

<ul>
<li>If the amount of arguments is &ldquo;!=&rdquo; == &ldquo;-ne&rdquo; to one. Then print usage error</li>
<li>Save the one and only argument to a variable called file. And store the last updated time information into another variable called initial_time</li>
<li>Save the pid of the tmux pane the script is in. Clear the terminal. And launch glow</li>
<li>In a while loop. If the time information of the file has changed then <C-c> to reset everything in the pane. Incase cursor position is not neutral. Then run glow again</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>A script that does what I wanted it to has been birthed. This was my first experience with writing bash scripts and it was a step forward into doing what I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do but was scared of the syntax of bash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved automation and scripting to increase the quality of life. And I think I will continue to do so but now with bash + python.</p>
<p>ok bye.</p>
