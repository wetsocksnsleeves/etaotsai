  <meta property="og:description" content="About Hey, I am Etao and I am a Computer Science student at The University of Queensland.
I am driven by my deep passion for computers, and I aspire to become a security researcher and help the world by securing technology that we all actively use everyday.
I have been passionate in technology every since I was in primary school, helping my teacher build websites, and building games in my spare time. In highschool, I was actively participating in STEM projects ranging from building prosthetics, automatic fish feeders, controllers and games. And of course in my spare time I’ve build many more games, programs, scripts to help me automate tasks and learning more about computers.
Interests Building secure programs Building computers, drones, and 3D printers OSINT challenges and GeoGuessr Trying to improve at OSINT and other Cybersecurity related tasks Building machines from scratch">
