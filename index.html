  <meta property="og:description" content="About Hey, I am Etao and I am a Computer Science student at The University of Queensland.
I am driven by my deep passion for computers, and I aspire to become a security researcher and help the world by securing technology that we all actively use everyday.
I have been passionate in technology every since I was in primary school, helping my teacher build websites, and building games in my spare time. In highschool, I was actively participating in STEM projects ranging from building prosthetics, automatic fish feeders, controllers and games. And of course in my spare time I‚Äôve build many more games, programs, scripts to help me automate tasks and learning more about computers.
Interests Building solutions to problems I have. Tinkering with computers, drones, and 3D printers Trying to improve at Being a computer scientist Fishing Other computer unrelated hobbies">
